## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

In this Unity project I'm storing small templates that I'm making to be able to consult them or use them if necessary, like for example the credits screen, my custom SplashScreen, an FPS controller, API calls, etc...

This project is not a game.

## About the development and improvements

You can currently find in this project:
